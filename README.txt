The prrogram sorts an integer array using the following sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Selection sort

The application should be run with the following command-line syntax:
./sort "4 5 2 1 9"
=> sort is the name of the executable file
=> Second argument is the unordered array. The array should be entered as a string, where each element is separated with a whitespace

Directory structure of this project is as follows:
- /include has all the user-defined header files
- /lib has source for the application's library functions
- /src has the source code for the application's main entry point
- /test has unit tests to verify functionality
